# Mentorship Guide for Kubernetes Labs

## Learning Outcomes
By completing these labs, students will be able to:
- Understand the fundamentals of Kubernetes objects (Pods, Deployments, Services, Ingress).
- Apply declarative YAML manifests to manage Kubernetes workloads.
- Demonstrate scaling and resource management for applications.
- Implement configuration and secret management securely.
- Troubleshoot common Kubernetes issues effectively.

## Suggested Flow for Students
1. **Lab 01 - Basic Pod**  
   - Learn how to create a Pod and expose it locally.  
2. **Lab 02 - Deployment & Service**  
   - Explore replicas, rolling updates, and Service exposure.  
3. **Lab 03 - Ingress**  
   - Route traffic between multiple applications.  
4. **Lab 04 - ConfigMaps & Secrets**  
   - Manage externalized configuration and sensitive data.  
5. **Lab 05 - Resource Limits**  
   - Apply CPU/memory constraints and test resource usage.  
6. **Lab 06 - Deployments & Scaling**  
   - Scale applications and verify load distribution.  

## Assessment Criteria
- ✅ Student can successfully deploy and scale Pods.  
- ✅ Student explains the purpose of Services vs Ingress.  
- ✅ Student demonstrates secure usage of ConfigMaps and Secrets.  
- ✅ Student monitors Pods and resolves basic troubleshooting issues.
